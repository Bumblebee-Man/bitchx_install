BitchX Ansible Install
=====================================             
BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka panasync@efnet.

What is this?
==============:
This is a simple ansible play to install BitchX along with a plain
.bitchxrc

This play is using Dan Mashal's (dan.mashal@fedoraproject.org) BitchX1.3 GitHub project
(https://github.com/BitchX/BitchX1.3)

Note to user
=============
The BitchX 1.3 project hasn't been updated since 2012 and I'm just learning Ansible,
use at your own risk.
